				Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club
				based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that
				competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English
				football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as
				Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to
				Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old
				Trafford, in 1910.<br />
				Manchester United have won more trophies than any other club in
				English football, with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups,
				five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. United
				have also won three European Cups/UEFA Champions Leagues, one
				UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super
				Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In
				1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English
				football to achieve the continental European treble. By winning
				the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs
				to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.<br />
				The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players.
				In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United
				became the first English football club to win the European Cup.
				Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier
				League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between
				1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement. Manchester
				United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the
				world, and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City,
				Arsenal and Leeds United.<br />
				Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the
				world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,1
				and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019,
				valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion). After being floated on
				the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private
				after a purchase by Malcolm Glazer in 2005 at almost £800
				million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the
				club's debt.1 From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on
				the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains
				overall ownership and control of the club.
